        <h2>About MICCAI</h2>
        <p>The 28th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2025) will be held from Tuesday September 23rd to Friday September 27th 2025 in Daejeon, Republic of Korea. This will be the first MICCAI conference hosted in Korea <br> The MICCAI 2025 organizing committee and the local team in South Korea have been working diligently at planning the conference for years. We are dedicated to making sure that MICCAI 2025 will be a great experience for everyone! <br>The annual MICCAI conference attracts the world’s leading biomedical scientists, engineers, and clinicians from a wide range of disciplines associated with medical imaging and computer assisted intervention. The conference series includes three days of scientific content, including oral presentations and poster sessions. Workshops, tutorials, and challenges are held on the days preceding and succeeding the conference. Delegates can enjoy many different session formats in these satellite events that offer a comprehensive forum to further explore topics relevant to MICCAI. Industrial sessions and exhibitions provide interesting opportunities of exchange between academia and industry. The Student Board and Women in MICCAI Board will complete the program with exciting social events.</p>
        <h2>About the Workshop</h2>
        <p>
            Advances in medical image analysis have been largely driven by deep learning and AI techniques. Robustness represents a model's ability to maintain performance despite the in-herent variability in medical imaging environments. Without robust models, minor changes in image quality or acquisition parameters can lead to substantial errors in classification outcomes or imprecise segmentation boundaries. Generalizability extends beyond robustness, focusing on a model's capacity to perform effectively on entirely new, unseen datasets. Models lacking generalizability often fail to capture underlying features, instead memorizing specific aspects of the training data, limiting their practical utility. <br/> There are many strategies to improve robustness and generalization in deep learning models for neuroimaging. For robustness, methods include data augmentation to expand training datasets, adversarial training to bolster model resilience, noise reduction to mitigate imaging artifacts, and regularization to prevent overfitting. To enhance generalization, approaches such as transfer learning, domain adaptation, cross-validation strategies, and ensemble learning are examined for their effectiveness in adapting models across diverse datasets. <br/> Despite this progress, these models often face challenges such as Data Quality and Standardization, Population Variability and Cross-Site Generalization, Task-Specific Reliability, Interpretability. The workshop will feature expert talks, discussions of techniques, emerging challenges, and collaborative sessions to identify future directions for improving model robustness and generalization. Participants will also engage in hands-on activities to test cutting-edge tools and methods. <br/> The event serves as a platform for researchers and practitioners to share innovative approaches to address key challenges in medical image analysis, such as limited labeled data, inter-hospital variability, and heterogeneity in patient populations. By fostering collaboration between academia and industry, the workshop aims to bridge the gap between theoretical advances and practical applications in clinical settings.
